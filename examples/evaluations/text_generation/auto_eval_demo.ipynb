I figure as long as there is nothing wrong, why go see the doctor?\\n#Person1#: Well, the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early.

Do you smoke, Mr. Smith?\\n#Person2#: Yes.\\n#Person1#: Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease, you know. You really should quit.\\n#Person2#: I've tried hundreds of times, but I just can't seem to kick the habit.\\n#Person1#: Well, we have classes and some medications that might help.
